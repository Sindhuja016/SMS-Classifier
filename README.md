SMS Spam Classifier

**Introduction:**
This project aims to develop a text classification model using data science techniques in Python to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The model will help identify and filter out unwanted spam messages from legitimate ones, enhancing user experience and reducing potential risks associated with spam.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project contains labeled SMS messages, with each message tagged as either spam or non-spam. The dataset can be found [here](link-to-dataset). It consists of two columns: 'text' containing the SMS message and 'label' indicating whether the message is spam or non-spam.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**
- Python: Programming language used for development.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building classification models.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Library for natural language processing tasks.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.

**Steps Involved:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform basic data cleaning such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Explore the dataset to gain insights.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (words or phrases).
   - Text Normalization: Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
   - Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Choose appropriate classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Logistic Regression.
   - Train the model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune the model hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
   - Handle class imbalance issues if present.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Save the trained model using serialization techniques like Pickle or Joblib.
   - Create a user-friendly interface (e.g., web app or command-line tool) for users to input SMS messages and get predictions.
